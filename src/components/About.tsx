                I'm Atharva Werulkar, a passionate and solution-driven Flutter Developer with a strong 
                foundation in both frontend and backend development. Over the years, I've developed, 
                deployed, and optimized multiple cross-platform mobile apps, many of which are live on the Play Store.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I specialize in crafting scalable and performant applications with dynamic UIs, custom logic, 
                real-time features, and seamless API integrations. Beyond Flutter, I've explored and implemented 
                technologies across the full stackâ€”from building Node.js APIs and integrating Supabase databases, 
                to working with Salesforce Apex for custom automation.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I also have experience working with generative AI models like SRGANs for image super-resolution, 
                and building tools like UpSync, a scalable app version control platform with a dedicated mobile and web portal.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                With hands-on experience in Firebase, real-time data sync, and JSON-based dynamic UI rendering, 
                I enjoy building robust solutions that are user-centric and developer-friendly. I'm also a strong 
                believer in clean architecture, team collaboration, and continuous learning.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Currently, I'm actively contributing to production-grade apps and SaaS platforms, and I'm always 
                eager to learn new technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible in mobile and cloud computing.
